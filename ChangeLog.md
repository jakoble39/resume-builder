### 0.6 / 2015-05-07

* Probably the second major refactor of the resume to get it even more componentised

### 1.0 / 2015-09-06

* Added Japanese language resume and did a complete refactor of the app

### 1.1 / 2015-11-12

Refactored to get any non-Prawn-related code out of the PDF classes.
All processing of the resume data hash (decoding of Base 64 values, fetching
of images etc) happens before the resume is generated.
